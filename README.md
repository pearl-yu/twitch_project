# twitch_project

This is a currently a public repository. I might change it to private this week. I could add your accounts as collaborators, or think of other ways to share these (maybe a link to the notebook on my drive/ pdf).

- Sample dataset construction and initial insights: Uploaded 10092022 biteviij.
- Archived dataset: [TwitchTracker](https://sullygnome.com/channels/30/followergrowth) This is a really impressive data collection. I'm using this to dig in, looking for patterns. As this site pulls the twitch API every 15 minutes since 2015, I'm thinking emailing the developer to collaborate, as he indicated no scraping please. But this site doesn't scrape viewer engagement (chats).

  - Workflow:
    - Go to [TwitchTracker](https://sullygnome.com/channels/30/followergrowth) to select a sample, download the csv.
    - Use the url there to retrieve broadcast id and info by calling the get_user endpoint.
    - Use the retrieved video id to get video info by calling the get_videos endpoint.
    - Use the retreived video url to get chat files using the [chatdownloader](https://github.com/xenova/chat-downloader/tree/master/docs) github project.  **remember to download it locally too.**
    - Examine the returned json chat files, **see what variales to construct.** 

By Oct 11th:
- Uploaded 10122020 notebook. 

Action items: 
- Need to figure out when to rule out non-English vids. 
- Looped the code. But not very efficient. (no need for separate scripts actually.)
- What variables to construct from chats? How to quantify the dependent variables?
  - from the messages themselves: the count of messages. **What to extract from there?**
  - from the rich message: emotes, (cheermotes?)
  - from the API metadata: status of the viewer (subscriber, VIP, badges)
- Amazon - twitch financial statement? I think this could be combined with the twitch tracker overall summary to generate some insights.
- Take a look at json and generator stuff.https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/json
